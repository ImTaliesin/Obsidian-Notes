To find what data sources you are using and what they are pointing to, use
[[SQL]]` SELECT name, location FROM sys.external_data_sources`

1. External Table: An External Table is a database object that allows you to query data stored outside the database as if it were a regular table within the database. You'd want to create an External Table when:

- You need to access and analyze data stored in external sources without moving or copying it into your database.
- You want to maintain data in its original location while still being able to run SQL queries on it.
- You need to integrate data from various sources into your analytics workflow.

Benefits include reduced storage costs, real-time access to the latest data, and the ability to query data in different formats without ETL processes.

2. External Data Source: This represents the location where your data is actually stored, such as cloud storage services (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage) or Hadoop clusters. You'd define an External Data Source when:

- You want to connect your database to data stored in cloud storage or distributed file systems.
- You need to access data from multiple storage locations or services.

Defining External Data Sources allows you to manage connections to various data repositories centrally.

3. External File Format: This specifies how the data in the external source is structured (e.g., CSV, Parquet, JSON). You'd create an External File Format when:

- You need to inform the database about the structure of your external data.
- You want to query data in various formats without having to transform it first.

Defining External File Formats enables the database to correctly interpret and read the data from external sources.

4. Data Lake Storage: This is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You'd use Data Lake Storage when:

- You need to store vast amounts of raw data in its native format.
- You want a scalable and cost-effective solution for big data analytics and machine learning projects.
- You require the flexibility to run different types of analytics on your data.

Data Lakes are particularly useful for storing data that you might want to analyze in the future, even if you don't have immediate plans for it.

In summary, this architecture allows you to build a flexible and scalable data analytics system. It separates storage from compute, enabling you to store large volumes of data cost-effectively in a Data Lake while still being able to query it efficiently using familiar SQL tools through External Tables. This approach is particularly valuable in cloud-based data warehousing and big data scenarios where data volumes are large and diverse.
