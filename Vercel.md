  
To host a Git repository on Vercel, you can follow these steps using the Vercel CLI. If you haven't installed the Vercel CLI yet, you can do so by running `npm i -g vercel` in your terminal. Here's a basic guide to get your Git repository hosted:

1. **Login to Vercel:**
    
    - First, log in to Vercel through the CLI if you haven't already. Use:
        
        Copy code
        
        `vercel login`
        
    - Follow the prompts to log in with your Vercel account.
2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
    
    - Use the terminal to navigate to your project's directory:
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `cd path/to/your/project`
        
3. **Link Your Project to Vercel:**
    
    - If this is the first time you are deploying the project to Vercel, link your project by running:
        
        Copy code
        
        `vercel`
        
    - Follow the prompts to set up your project. You may need to link your Git repository if it's not linked yet. Vercel will guide you through the process.
4. **Deploy Your Project:**
    
    - After linking, you can deploy your project to Vercel with the same command:
        
        Copy code
        
        `vercel`
        
    - For subsequent deployments, just running `vercel` in your project directory will deploy the latest version.
5. **Configure Project (Optional):**
    
    - If you need to configure environment variables or other settings, you can do so in the Vercel dashboard or via the CLI using:
        
        phpCopy code
        
        `vercel env add <VARIABLE_NAME> <environment>`
        
    - Replace `<VARIABLE_NAME>` with your actual environment variable name and `<environment>` with the environment you want it to apply to (e.g., `production`, `preview`, or `development`).
6. **Alias Domain (Optional):**
    
    - After deploying, if you want to assign a custom domain to your deployment, use:
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `vercel alias set source destination`
        
    - Replace `source` with your deployment URL or ID and `destination` with your custom domain.

These steps cover the basic process of hosting a project from a Git repository on Vercel using the Vercel CLI. For specific configurations or advanced features, refer to the Vercel documentation.
